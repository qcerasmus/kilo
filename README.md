## TE
TE is a terminal text editor.

Currently we enter raw mode in the terminal so that we receive bytes instead of characters among other things.
To quit the editor, use `CTRL+Q`.
To save a file, use `CTRL+S`.

There is a welcome banner if no file is passed as an arguement.
If a file is passed as an arguement, the full file is now navigatable.
