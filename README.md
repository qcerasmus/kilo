## TE
TE is a terminal text editor.

Currently we enter raw mode in the terminal so that we receive bytes instead of characters among other things.
To quit the editor, use `CTRL+Q`.

So far there is a welcome banner and you can move the cursor with arrow keys.
PageUp, PageDown, Home and End work as well.
